# Wall Crack Detection 🧱🧠

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of walls into two categories:
- **Cracks**
- **Non Cracks**

The model is trained on a custom dataset and performs binary classification using a simple custom CNN architecture.
